# Tribute Page
A tribute page dedicated to Dr. Norman Borlaug, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.
The page was built using plain HTML and CSS only. I used media queries to create a responsive layout.

You can find the live preview [here](https://mayanesrine.github.io/freeCodeCamp-TributePage/).
